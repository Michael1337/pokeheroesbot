## üßê About <a name="about"></a>

This project is a Node.js-based bot for automating gameplay actions on the Pok√©mon fan browser clicker game [pokeheroes.com](https://pokeheroes.com).  
From their description, "Pok√©Heroes is a Pok√©mon online roleplay game where you explore mysterious areas, hunt for shiny Pok√©mon and complete quests with many legendaries!"  
This bot is not merely a userscript running in a web browser. It is a node.js application that is supposed to run on a server or personal computer.
Developed for personal use and easily deployable for anyone with a bit of technical knowledge.

### üîé Suspicion

A note on suspicion: The bot sends a request to the game forum after every action to appear stealthy. This behavior makes it look like the user is simply browsing the forum rather than performing many different, rapid interactions.

Additionally, disabling all profile widgets such as Medals, Plushies, Badges, and Last Activity is recommended to hide most bot activity.

However, some behaviors may still draw attention:

- If configured to do so, the bot can win almost all Magearna raffles. This is what actually got my last account banned. It is advisable to never increase the raffle chance to more than 20 %, and to sell the vouchers on the (anonymous) item market for PD instead of trading, and then selling the PD for nuggets on the item market.  
- The bot solves an inhuman number of Hangman puzzles (one every 2 minutes -> 720 every day). Increasing this number to more than every 10 seconds can trigger the game's automatic anti-cheat system; and even with default settings, high Hangman counts may lead to bans if reviewed by an admin.  
- The bot regularly dominates the Bug Hatching Contest, often placing more than 10 times in the Top 20. To mitigate this, only a few high-scoring Pok√©mon are submitted for rating, but some may still find the results suspicious.  
- The bot avoids appearing on the rank list or medal rally by limiting interactions and Royal Tunnel levels. However, the total number interactions and fed berries may eventually appear in the ranking, possibly triggering an admin inspection.  
- The bot runs 24/7, but you do not; some users may message you in-game and wonder why you do not respond. Also, a play time of 3,000 hours in 5 months or 8,000 hours in a year was suspicious for many users. You may want to create an account, not use it for a year, and only then start using the bot with it.
- Making too many guest clicks from the Tor network will draw attention from the admins. That's why the bot focuses on hatching Pok√©mon using guest clicks, but not leveling/evolving them using guest clicks.

## üí≠ How it works <a name="working"></a>
See `package.json` for the full dependency list.

- Written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- Schedules jobs using `node-schedule` for regular actions (minigames, interactions, resource checks, etc.).
- Does requests using `node-fetch` and [axios](https://axios-http.com/).
- Parses game content using `Regex` and [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/).
- Handles authentication via `.env`-provided cookies.
- Handles in-game configurations using a structured in-game message for easy adjustments.
- Deploys and runs automatically via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and `Docker Compose`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

### In-game Requirements

The bot uses many features of the game. For some of the functions, certain assumptions are made by the bot, and you have to make sure these are fulfilled. This includes:  
- Have a Private Message to/with yourself for the config.  
- Have these boxes:  
  - 2+ slots in Egg Storage
  - 1 box called "New"
  - 1 box called "Special" (holding your Miltanks, Combees, and any other Pok√©mon not to be sold.)
  - 1 box called "Bugs" (for bug-hatching contest)
  - 1 box called "Temp" (size 1,000)
  - 1+ boxes called "Pokedex" (each size 1,000)
  - 1+ boxes called "Duplicates" (each size 1,000)
- Example: [ClickDeeClack](https://pokeheroes.com/userboxes?name=ClickDeeClack)

Also, your game account needs to be able to do some advanced actions. While the following is not strictly necessary to run the bot, it is highly advised for the best performance:  
- Being at least Trainer level 15, preferably level 35.  
- Having Premium. I suggest buying premium for a month by selling your Magearna vouchers (increase hangman interval to 10 seonds in code, and configure a 90 % win rate in the daily raffle for that) and trading the PDs for nuggets. Trading a Manaphy may also be possible, but highly suspicious for a new account. Once you have premium for a month, wait for the next Magearna Master Ball or some Shiny Magearna and sell those until you have 8,000 nuggets for a year of premium. Then adjust the hangman interval to 2 minutes and configure the daily raffle to be at 10 to 20 %.  

### Technical prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22 (Alpine image used in Dockerfile)
- Docker + Docker Compose (for container deployment)

### Environment Configuration (`.env`) <a name="config-env"></a>

The `.env` file contains configuration values and secrets your bot needs to operate. Copy the `.env.template` file and rename your copy to `.env`. Below is a description of each variable:

#### Login Configuration:

Crucial identification and authentication configuration to let the bot know what account you are using on pokeheroes.com.

- **`COOKIE`**  
  The HTTP cookie string for authenticating your session on PokeHeroes. This includes your session ID (`PHPSESSID`), username, and password hashes. It allows the bot to act as your logged-in user by sending requests with this cookie. To get the cookie, login into your pokeheroes.com account and extract the cookies from your browser. If you don't know how to do that, google it for your specific brwoser.

- **`APP_USERNAME`**  
  Your PokeHeroes username used by the bot to identify your account for a few tasks.

- **`CONFIG_MESSAGE_ID`**  
  An in-game private message ID used by the bot for some chaning configurations. More on that at [In-game Configuration](#config-ingame).

#### Gotify Configuration:

This bot supports gotifiy, in case you want to use it.

- **`GOTIFY_URL`**  
  The URL of your Gotify server for receiving notifications.

- **`GOTIFY_TOKEN`**  
  The authentication token to post messages to your Gotify instance.

#### Email Configuration:

This bot uses email notifications for some events like news on pokeheroes.com or run-time errors. This email config defines both the sending and receiving address.

- **`EMAIL_SERVICE`**  
  The email provider/service name (e.g., `gmail`).

- **`EMAIL_USER`**  
  The email address used to send notifications.

- **`EMAIL_PASS`**  
  The password or app-specific password for the email account.

#### Tor Configuration:

This bot supports anonymous guest clicks. For this, you may want to setup a Tor service on your server or local machine and put the config info here.

- **`TOR_PROXY`**  
  The SOCKS5 proxy URL for routing the bot's traffic through the Tor network (e.g., `socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050`).

- **`TOR_CONTROL_HOST`**  
  Hostname for controlling the Tor service (usually same as proxy hostname). If you have your tor proxy in a docker container, you may use the container's name instead of the IP address.

- **`TOR_CONTROL_PORT`**  
  Port for the Tor control interface (typically `9051`).

### In-game Configuration <a name="config-ingame"></a>

Some light configurations are defined in-game so the bot does not have to restart for small adjustments. These configurations are made in an in-game message. To set this up, send yourself an in-game private message including the following structure. Then get the ID from the URL, e.g. `pokeheroes.com/pm_read?id=123456` would have the ID `123456`. This is used in the [`CONFIG_MESSAGE_ID`](#config-env).  
The message may only contain these keys and values, structured like this:

```
PARTY_MAX_HOOPA:0
PREFERRED_BERRY:Oran
AVAILABLE_POKEMONS_RUMBLE:[1,2,3,4]
...:...
```

## TODOs <a name="todos"></a>

Some features that are not implemented yet because my account was banned before I got to them:

- See inline TODOs in code and comments.
- Rowan contest like Oak contest.
- Other early-game features like completing the tutorial.
- Rumbling needs to be made more efficient and be able to work with Galar and Alola region.
- Some statistics like Pok√©dex, Eggdex, Berrydex, and Puzzle Pieces.
  - Then also add them in user profile as progress bar to show off.
- Buy gems and other valuables when they are "very cheap" in the GTS item market.
- Battling. Like at all. But very unrewarding, unfortunately.
- More special Pok√©dex entries:
  - Shiny Mega hunts, or hunts in general, using the Pok√©Radar and Day care, and maybe a new storage box.
  - Giga evolutions need to be implented at all.
  - Driftloon: https://pokeheroes.com/forum_thread?id=69737 (Alternatively, for OT, breed it, like with Munchlax and Combee eggdex.)
  - Castforms need to be collected more often/actively, instead of the regular evolution cycle.
  - More special evolutions like event Pok√©mon need to be added to the evolution list.
  - Maybe check moon phases for some legendaries, but most legendaries need to be done manually, anyways.
- Might implement selling more duplicates if it can be determined if a certain duplicate is not necessary anymore because the Pok√©dex is complete for example.
- Might redeem vouchers automatically Uxie/Mesprit/Azelf when party is empty.
- Might do more checks for a full party at certain points where an egg might be adopted, like the memory game. But working with a party size of 5 works very well, too.
